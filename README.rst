An OSeMOSYS model of the European Union, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom

Description
-----------

**OSeMBE** is an Energy model base for the European Union developed using the OSeMOSYS Modelling Framework.
The model provides country-detailed representation of the 27 European Union (EU) Member States, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The model aims at being used as a multi-regional stakeholders engagement model at the European level.
The development was funded by the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 691739.

Setup and Installation
----------------------

To use the model you need to install GLPK and a solver such as CBC, gurobi or CPLEX.

It is recommended to run the dataset in combination with the fast code of  OSeMOSYS v1.0.1. To be found here: https://github.com/OSeMOSYS/OSeMOSYS_GNU_MathProg/releases/download/v1.0.1/osemosys_gnu_mathprog_v1.0.1.zip 

It is recomended to use otoole v0.10.0 to handle input and output data. It can be installed by using::

    pip install otoole==0.10.0

For the visualisation scripts you should have an environment with the following dependencies:

- `python` >= 3.6 
- `pandas`
- `plotly`

Folder structure
----------------

- Input data are stored as `datapackages` in the `input_data` folder
