The Open Source energy Model Base for the European Union (OSeMBE)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

An Energy model base for the European Union developed using the **OSeMOSYS** Modelling Framework.
The model provides country-detailed representation of the 28 European Union (EU) Member States + Switzerland and Norway. The model aims at being used as a multi-regional stakeholders engagement model at the European level.
The development was funded by the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 691739.

Setup and Installation
----------------------

To run this analysis you need to install GLPK and a solver such as CBC, gurobi or CPLEX.

It is recommended to run the dataset in combination with the fast code of  OSeMOSYS v1.0.1. https://github.com/OSeMOSYS/OSeMOSYS_GNU_MathProg/releases/download/v1.0.1/osemosys_gnu_mathprog_v1.0.1.zip 

For the visualisation scripts you should have an environment with the following dependencies:
- `python` >= 3.6 
- `pandas`
- `plotly`

Folder structure
----------------

- Input data are stored as `datapackages` in the `input_data` folder
- A modified OSeMOSYS model file is stored in the `model` folder
